# Announcements System

The announcements system is now completely database-driven with no hardcoded data.

## Database Setup

1. **Run Prisma Migration**:
   ```bash
   npx prisma migrate deploy
   npx prisma generate
   ```

2. **Seed Database** (optional, for sample data):
   ```bash
   npm run seed
   ```

## Features

### Database-Driven
- All announcements are stored in the `announcements` table
- No hardcoded or mock data in the application
- Graceful error handling if database is not available

### API Endpoints
- `GET /api/courses/[courseId]/announcements` - Fetch course announcements
- `POST /api/courses/[courseId]/announcements` - Create new announcement
- `PUT /api/announcements/[announcementId]` - Update announcement
- `DELETE /api/announcements/[announcementId]` - Delete announcement

### Access Control
- Students can view published announcements
- Instructors can create, edit, and delete announcements
- Admins have full access

### Features
- Priority levels (Low, Normal, High)
- Important flag for critical announcements
- Draft system for instructors
- Rich text content support
- Author attribution
- Responsive design

## Empty State Handling

When no announcements exist:
- Students see a message that no announcements have been posted
- Instructors see a call-to-action to create the first announcement
- No fallback to mock data

## Error Handling

- Database connection issues return empty array instead of errors
- API failures are logged and handled gracefully
- Frontend shows appropriate error states

## Usage

1. Instructors can create announcements using the "New Announcement" button
2. Announcements can be saved as drafts or published immediately
3. Students see only published announcements in chronological order
4. Important announcements are highlighted and shown first
