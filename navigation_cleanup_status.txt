// Based on the search results, it seems the virtual classroom references may have already been removed
// from the Navigation component, or they might be in a different location.

// Let me check if the mobile menu virtual classroom reference has already been cleaned up
// or if it exists in a different navigation component.

// If you're still seeing virtual classroom references in the mobile menu,
// they might be in one of these potential locations:
// 1. A different navigation component file
// 2. A mobile-specific navigation component
// 3. Within a layout component
// 4. In the main app layout

// Could you please specify exactly where you're seeing the virtual classroom reference?
// This will help me locate and remove it more accurately.
